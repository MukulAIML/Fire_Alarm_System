# ðŸ”¥ Image Processing Based Fire Detection

This project uses traditional image processing techniques and a trained machine learning model to detect fire in images or video. The system is built using Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow, and NumPy, and is executable through a simple command-line interface.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Fire detection using color and shape-based image processing
- Trained ML model for classification
- Real-time or static image-based detection
- Accuracy reporting and confusion matrix evaluation
- Lightweight and easy to deploy
